# XMusic - Music Player
Hey guys! This is my first repo i've uploaded to github. This is a program that took me about an hour to code, simply because I got pretty bored so I just decided to develop something. What I have developed is called XMusic, and it is an extremely light and portable music player. The best use of this program is for cpu/ram intensive programs that you don't want to take a hit to, because Spotify is taking 100mb of ram. Please don't get mad at me for not naming my control variables, again, it was more speedcoding than organization. 

# How to use 
1. Run the program and it will create a folder called 'music' if it does not already exist. The music folder will be created in the directory in which you ran the program.
2. Double click on the white box in the program to open the music folder, drag and drop .MP3 files in the folder. .WAV support will be coming if I decide to update this program.
3. The files should appear in the white box, to play them, select them in the box. Once ready, hit play to start the music.
